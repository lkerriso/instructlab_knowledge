Context chunks must exactly match content in markdown file
The markdown file can include addtl content and it WILL be included in the context window
Markdown / qna cannot include embedded links. It won’t error they’re just taking up token space unnecessarily.
Only 5 context chunks, and only 3 qna pairs per context. Addtl will be ignored.
The qna is used as examples for SDG. The actual questions are not directly used. So that’s why there will be maybe some error/issue trying to ask those specific questions. Probably best to test the questions generated in the knowledge_train_msgs file. 
Don’t use AI to create qna, the questions need to capture the intent of the users. Language model would create basic stuff that might be completely useless.
   A. If you have a huge md file, you want to select the contexts very specifically. You want to spread it out from the document, maybe not randomly chosen. There is a best practice of doing this. The LLM might choose the first 5 paragraphs as contexts.
   B. You could maybe have a clever prompt that would prompt the LLM to help you decide what topics to write qnas for.
Yes/No question/answers aren’t as helpful as answers that expound upon the question or something.
